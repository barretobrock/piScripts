# piScripts
These are a collection of scripts I use on my raspberry Pi(s). 

The following is a rough log of additional changes applied to the system.

The code used to change ownership:
```
sudo chmod -R 777 /path/to/file
```
This was applied to the following files:
  - tempHumSave.py
  - realtime.R
